\section{Problem Definition}\label{sec:prelims}
In this section we formally introduce the problem and define our goal.

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph with $|V|=n$ vertices. W.l.o.g.~we let $V=[n]$. Let
$\family\subseteq 2^V$ be a collection of subsets of $V$, i.e., a collection of
sets of nodes. Let $\pi$ be a function from $\family$ to $[0,1]$ (not
necessarily a probability distribution). We model the generation and diffusion
of information information in the network by defining a \emph{generating
process} $\sys=(\family,\pi)$.  $\sys$ is a infinite discrete-time process
which, at each time step $t$, generates a set $\Sample_t\subseteq\family$ such
that $S\in\family$ is included in $\Sample_t$ with probability $\pi(S)$,
independently of $t$ and of other sets generated at time $t$ and at time $t'<t$.
For any $t$ and any $S\in\Sample_t$, we call the ordered pair $(t,S)$ an
\emph{item}, representing a piece of information that was generated at time $t$
and reached \emph{instantaneously} the nodes in $S$.  We choose to model the
diffusion process as instantaneous because it appears as such to a
resource-limited observer who does not have the resources to monitor all the
network at the fine time granularity needed to observe the different stages of
the diffusion process.

\para{Probing and schedule} The observer can only monitor the network by
\emph{probing} nodes. Formally, by \emph{probing a node $v\in V$ at time $t$},
we mean obtaining the set $I(t,v)$ of items $(t',S)$ such
that $t'\le t$ and $v\in S$:
\[
	I(t,v)\defeq\{(t',S) ~:~ t'\le t, S\in\Sample_{t'}, v\in S\}\enspace.
\]
Let $U_t$ be the union of the sets $\Sample_{t'}$ generated by $\sys$
at any time $t'\le t$, then we have $I(t,v)\subseteq U_t$. We assume that
probing a node is not a computationally expensive operation: probing a node $v$
at time $t$ gives immediate access to $I(t,v)$. This is a realistic assumption:
for example, accessing the profile of a user in a social network gives access to
the list of items that reached that user.

We model the \emph{resource limitedness of the observer} through a constant,
user-specified, parameter $c\in\mathbb{N}$, representing the maximum number of
nodes that can be probed at any time $t$.

The observer chooses the $c$ nodes to probe by following a schedule. In this work
we focus on \emph{memoryless} schedules, i.e., the choice of nodes to probe at
time $t$ is independent from the choice of nodes to probe at any time $t'<t$.
More precisely, a \emph{probing $c$-schedule} $\sched$ is a probability
distribution on $V$. At each time $t$, the observer chooses as set $P_t$ of $c$
nodes to probe, such that $P_t$ is obtained through \emph{random sampling of $V$
without replacement according to $\sched$}, independently from $P_{t'}$ from
$t'< t$. We postpone the study of adaptive or sequential schedules to future
work.

\para{Caught items, uncaught items, and freshness}
We say that an item $(t',S)$ is \emph{caught at time $t\ge t'$} iff
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item a node $v\in S$ is probed at time $t$; and
	\item no node in $S$ was probed in the interval $[t',t-1]$.
\end{enumerate*}

Let $C_t$ be the set of items caught by the observer at any time $t'\le t$. We
have $C_t\subseteq U_t$. Let $N_t= U_t\setminus C_t$ be the \emph{set of
uncaught items at time $t$}, i.e., items that were generated at any time
$t'\le t$ and have not been caught yet at time $t$. For any item $(t',S)\in
N_t$, we define the \emph{$\theta$-freshness of $(t',S)$ at time $t$} as
\[
	\fresh_\theta(t,t',S)\defeq\theta^{t-t'},
\]
where $\theta\in(0,1)$ is a user-specified parameter modeling how fast the
value of an item decreases with time if uncaught. Intuitively, pieces of
information (e.g., rumors) have high value if caught almost as soon as they have
appeared in the network, but their value decreases fast (e.g., exponentially) as
more time passes before being uncaught, to the point of having no value in the
limit. In the rest of the paper we drop the $\theta$ from the notation of
freshness of an item at time $t'$ as it will be clear from the context.

\para{Load of the system and cost of a schedule} The set $N_t$ of uncaught items
at time $t$ imposes a \emph{$\theta$-load $L_\theta(t)$ on the graph at time
$t$}, defined as the sum of the $\theta$-freshness at time $t$ of the items in
$N_t$:
\[
	L_\theta(t)\defeq\sum_{(t',S)\in N_t} \fresh_\theta(t,t',S)\enspace.
\]
The quantity $L_\theta(t)$ is a random variable, depending both on $\sys$ and on
the probing schedule $\sched$, and as such it has an expectation
$\expect[L_\theta(t)]$ w.r.t.~all the randomness in the system. The
\emph{$\theta$-cost of a schedule $\sched$} is defined as the limit, for
$t\rightarrow\infty$, of the average expected load of the system:
\[
	\cost_\theta(\sched)\defeq\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{t}\sum_{t'\le
	t}\expect[L_\theta(t)]=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{t}\sum_{t'\le
	t}\expect\left[\sum_{(t'',S)\in N_{t'}}\fresh_\theta(t',t'',S)\right]\enspace.
\]
\todo{Add some motivation/intuition for this choice of cost measure.}
The limit above always exists as proven in Lemma~\ref{lem:explicit}.
\todo{Is the proof of existence actually there?}

We now have all the necessary ingredients to formally define the problem of
interest in this work.

\para{Problem definition} Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and $\sys=(\family,\pi)$ be a
generating process on $G$. Let $c\in\mathbb{N}$ and
$\theta\in(0,1)$. The \emph{$(\theta,c)$-Optimal Probing Schedule Problem}
($(\theta,c)$-OPSP) requires to find the \emph{optimal $c$-schedule} $\sched^*$,
i.e., the schedule with \emph{minimum} $\theta$-cost over the set $\mathsf{S}_c$
of $c$-schedules.
\[
	\sched^*=\argmin\{\cost_\theta(\sched), \sched\in\mathsf{S}_c\}\enspace.
\]

In other words, the goal is to design a $c$-schedule that allows to catch items
that have higher freshness (which correspond to those generated most recently).
Tthe parameter $\theta$ controls how fast the freshness of an item decays, i.e.,
how fast they loose value for the agent. A value of $\theta$ very close to $0$
requires to catch the item  as soon as they are generated (or at most shortly
thereafter). At the other extreme ($\theta\approx 1$), an ideal schedule should
try to maximize the number of caught items, as their freshness decays very
slowly. In other words, the optimal schedule is such that elements of $U$ more
likely to receive ``fresh'' items have higher probability of being probed.
Intuitively, if we see the items as the ``information'' flowing in the network,
then an ideal schedule should assign higher probability of being probed to nodes
that act as \emph{fresh information hubs}, i.e., receive a large number of
items. Hence by examining the optimal schedule $\sched$, we can identify
information hubs among the nodes. This task (finding information hubs) can be
seen as the complement of the \emph{influence maximization
problem}~\citep{Kempe2003,Kempe2005}. In the influence maximization problem we
look for a set of nodes that \emph{generate} information that reach most nodes.
In the information hubs problem we are interested in a set of nodes that
\emph{receive} the most of information, thus the most informative nodes for an
observer.

In the following sections, we almost often drop the specification of the
parameters from $\theta$-freshness, $\theta$-cost, $\theta$-load, and
$c$-schedule, and from their respective notation, as the parameters will be
clear from the context.

% Commented by Matteo on 6/30
%In a social network, news and pictures are shared and re-shared over time, and
%each such shared ``item'' reaches a certain set of users. A resource-limited
%agent is interested in knowing what items get shared on the network. Also, the
%agent would like to know as soon as possible that an item has been shared,
%because the value of this piece of information decreases over time. Being
%resource-limited, the only way that the agent can observe (catch) the sharing of
%items is to probe some nodes (i.e., users) of the social network, for example by
%accessing their profile and getting a list of the items that they received from
%other users or that they shared. Therefore, the agent needs a probing schedule
%that allows her to catch as many items as possible while minimizing the time
%between the sharing of an item and its being caught. Equivalently, the schedule
%must be such that the ``value'' of the information that is not caught by the
%agent is minimized. Intuitively, the schedule must be such that nodes that
%receive a high number of items shortly after they have been generated should
%have a higher probability of being probed. These nodes act, in some sense, as
%``information hubs''. As such, identifying them can be seen as the complement of
%the \emph{influence maximization problem}~\citep{Kempe2003,Kempe2005}. In the
%influence maximization problem we look for a set of nodes that \emph{generate}
%information that reach most nodes. In the information hubs problem we are
%interested in a set of nodes that \emph{receive} the most of information, thus
%the most informative nodes for an observer.
